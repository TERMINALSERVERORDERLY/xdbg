    "## Motivation\n",
    "I write Python code in Jupyter notebooks every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing any sort of complicated behavior, I start by assigning sample inputs to variable. Then I operate on them step-by-step in different notebook cells. The interactive notebook systems lets me inspect intermediate values, and react to bugs by re-running a single cell instead of restarting the program from scratch. Once I've tested that everything works, I consolidate the steps and move them into a function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the interactivity ends there. IPython's execution model works great at global scope, but doesn't support entering the body of a function or class. If code in a function has a bug, I have to completely switch workflows. Often times I end up doing inefficient debugging with print statements. A debugger can work better, but the options available are closer to a bare-bones python REPL than to the full interactive power of the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo is proposal for running interactive Python code *inside local scope*."

    "The code for the `xdbg` module is available at http://github.com/nikitakit/xdbg\n",
    "\n",
    "It requires __Python 3.5__, as well as a recent version of Jupyter and the IPython kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is best used in combination with the [deuterium](https://atom.io/packages/deuterium) plugin for the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io), which is what is used in the demo."
