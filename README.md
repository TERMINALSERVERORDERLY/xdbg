See http://kitaev.io/xdbg for more details.

`xdbg` provides advanced live coding for Python.

It is best used in combination with the [hydrogen package](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen) for the Atom text editor.

## Features
`xdbg` extends IPython to allow executing live code at any scope within the running program, including:
  * Within any imported module
  * Inside function scope (including support for closures)

## Installation

### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* IPython
* byteplay3

### To Install

Run `pip install git+https://github.com/nikitakit/xdbg` (or clone the repository and use `setup.py`)

You can activate `xdbg` inside an IPython kernel by running `%load_ext xdbg`. To load it automatically,
list it in your IPython configuration file, e.g.

```python
c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = ['xdbg']
```

The configuration file is usually located at `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py`, and can be
generated by running `ipython profile create`.
